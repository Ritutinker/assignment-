Ques 1.Create an interface Shape with  abstract method int area().
  classes should implement this interface---

a.Square -----with one data member length ,class should implement this interface Shape,


b.Rerctangle---with  one more data member --width ----class will extend Square area() should be overridden.
in main call area() of both. override area() in all and print their area

public interface Shape
